# üß¨ Sepsis Prediction via Temporal Pattern Mining & Deep Learning

This project tackles one of the most urgent challenges in healthcare: early detection of septic shock. Using ICU patient data from MIMIC-III, it compares temporal pattern mining with deep learning to identify high-risk patients up to 24 hours before onset. The goal is to maximize recall and minimize false negatives‚Äîwhere delayed intervention could mean the difference between life and death.

## üìä Overview

The project evaluates two modeling paradigms:

- **Recent Temporal Pattern (RTP) Mining**  
  Frequent temporal patterns are extracted from patient vitals and used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) classifiers.

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**  
  A sequential neural network is trained on padded time-series data to learn latent temporal dependencies in patient vitals.

## üéØ Objectives

- Predict septic shock onset 24 hours in advance using ICU vitals  
- Compare RTP-SVM, RTP-LR, and LSTM across five key metrics  
- Identify optimal model settings for clinical deployment  
- Propose strategies for extending the observation window without sacrificing predictive power

## üß† Model Architectures

**RTP Mining**
- Parameters: max gap (4‚Äì10 hrs), support thresholds (0.1‚Äì0.3)  
- Classifiers: SVM (poly kernel), LR  
- Output: Binary classification (Shock vs. Non-Shock)

**LSTM Neural Network**
- Layers: Masking ‚Üí LSTM (200 units) ‚Üí Dense (1 unit, sigmoid)  
- Padding: -10.0 fill value  
- Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.01)  
- Epochs: 10  
- Batch sizes tested: 64, 128, 256

## üìÅ Dataset

**Source**: MIMIC-III ICU admissions  
**Visits**: 796 (398 shock-positive, 398 non-shock)  
**Features Used**:
- Systolic Blood Pressure  
- Heart Rate  
- Respiratory Rate  
- Temperature  
- White Blood Cell Count  

**Observation Window**: All events ‚â•24 hours before diagnosis

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- AUC-ROC  

All models were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation.

## üîç Key Findings

| Metric       | Best Method | Score |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Accuracy     | RTP-SVM     | 0.842 |
| Precision    | RTP-LR      | 0.831 |
| Recall       | RTP-SVM     | 0.977 |
| F1 Score     | RTP-SVM     | 0.860 |
| AUC-ROC      | RTP-LR      | 0.917 |

- **RTP-SVM** excels in recall and F1-score, making it the most clinically viable model for early intervention.  
- **RTP-LR** offers strong precision and AUC-ROC, minimizing false positives.  
- **LSTM** underperforms relative to RTP methods, likely due to limited sequence depth and feature granularity.

## üí° Strategic Proposal

Inspired by Chi et al.‚Äôs work on RTP mining, this project achieved an F1-score of 0.860 with a 24-hour prediction window‚Äînearly matching their 0.868 score with just 4 hours of lead time. This suggests a promising opportunity:  
**Extend the observation window in 4-hour increments until the minimum acceptable F1-score is reached**, enabling even earlier detection and intervention.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- MIMIC-III is ICU-specific and may not generalize to broader hospital populations  
- Only five vitals were used; additional features could improve performance  
- LSTM architecture was not tuned beyond batch size and layer depth  
- RTP mining relies on discretized event sequences, which may lose nuance
